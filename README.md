Then run the following

```
  docker compose up
```

## Class/Method Authors

In the Java Spring app, methods are annotated with `@author` to indicate the person who worked on it. For functions/methods that aren't annotated, the group worked on it together.

The React app was worked on by Jared Chua.

## Known Issues

- The `backend` container's logs may indicate that it has failed to connect, but it should automatically restart itself after it has failed a couple of times. This is mainly due to the `db` container not fully ready to accept connections yet.
